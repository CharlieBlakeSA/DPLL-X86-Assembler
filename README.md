DPLL-X86-Assembler

An experiment in understanding & writing some X86 assembler. The aim of this project is to take a C implementation of the DPLL logic algorithm, asemble it, write some extra code directly in assembler, and then comment the rest of the assembler code to try and understand how it works.
